## CheckIns

An attendance record for an event.

If someone was checked out, `checked_out_at` will be present.

You can scope check-ins in a few ways:

- `regular`s, `guest`s, and `volunteer`s correspond to the option selected when checking in.
- `attendee`s are `regular`s and `guest`s together.
- `one_time_guest`s are check-ins which were created without a corresponding person record.
- `not_one_time_guest`s are check-ins which had a corresponding person record when they were created.
- `checked_out` are check-ins where `checked_out_at` is present (meaning they were checked out from a station).
- `first_time`s are check-ins which are the person's first for a given event. (One-time guests are not included here.)

## CheckInGroups

When one or more people check in, they're grouped in a `CheckInGroup`.
These check-ins all have the same "checked-in by" person. `CheckInGroup` is also
the basis for label printing.

`print_status` may be:

- `ready`: This group isn't printed or canceled yet
- `printed`: This group was successfully printed at a station
- `canceled`: This group was canceled at a station
- `skipped`: This group had no labels to print, so it was never printed.
